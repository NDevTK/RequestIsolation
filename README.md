# RequestIsolation
An experimental security extension to Isolate domains so they can only be accessed directly via the extension popup.
This prevents URL based reflected XSS, Timing attacks, CSRF, postMessage and clickjacking attacks.

# TLDR
- self-DoS-as-a-service
- well make Chrome unusable but very secure, that's gotta be worth it
- thanks I am a good slogan generator
